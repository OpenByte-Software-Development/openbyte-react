          Orange Belgiumâ€™s goal was to build a new internal tool that will allow
          visualizing financial data collected from many sources into one
          system.
          <br /> <br />
          The data will be collected from different sources, for example, some
          data should be collected from CSV, XLS files and some data should be
          collected via different services through rest-API.
          <br />
          <br />
          Different source channels should be updated frequently and we needed
          to build a bot that will call regularly those services in order to
          collect the data.
          <br /> <br />
          After data will be collected it should be transformed, cleaned, and
          prepared before being saved in our database.

          The main challenges was to upload or connect multiple sources and
          build reports for them. As a solution we decided to abstract and build
          module called connector that allow to implement custom connectors and
          import data from your own sources. <br />
          <br />
          That gives us more flexibility and possibility to extract data
          automatically by creating a daemon that extract data based on
          schedule.
